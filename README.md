Data Table Wizard
==========
A Wordpress plugin used by UBC

This plugin creates a wizard that sets up shortcodes for gravity forms and WP jQuery Data Tables. 
One must have the following plugins activated for this plugin to be useful:
	
	Gravity Forms
	Gravity Forms Directory & Addons
	Groups
	WP jQuery DataTable
	
This plugin allows the user to select a created Gravity form. The user can then add additional editable columns to the generated Gravity forms entries table (with help from WP JQuery DataTable Plugin). 
The user can then select what group can view the table. During the final step the user can insert the generated shortcode into the page. If a shortcode pertaining to this plugin is already in the content
the plugin will grab the data from that.
